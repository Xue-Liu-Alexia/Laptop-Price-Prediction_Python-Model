# Laptop-Price-Prediction_Python-Model

# About Dataset
The Uncleaned Laptop Price dataset is a collection of laptop product listings from an online e-commerce website. The dataset includes information about various laptop models, such as their brand, screen size, processor, memory, storage capacity, operating system, and price. However, the dataset is uncleaned, it contains missing values, inconsistent formatting, and other errors that need to be addressed before the data can be used for analysis or modelling.

The dataset contains categorical and numerical variables, with the majority of variables being categorical, including brand, model name, screen resolution, processor type, and operating system. Some numerical variables include screen size, memory, and storage capacity. The target variable in the dataset is the price, which is a continuous variable.
